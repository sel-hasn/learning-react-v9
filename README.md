# Learning React v9 

> **Note:** This repository contains code written while following Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to React v9](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v9/) on Frontend Masters. It is for educational purposes and personal reference.

## About
This project serves as a "code notebook" to document my progress in mastering React.js. Coming from a C/C++ background, the goal of this repository is not just to build UI, but to understand the underlying mechanisms of the Virtual DOM, state management, and component lifecycles.

## Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React 18+
* **Build Tool:** Vite (replaced `create-react-app`)
* **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)

## Concepts Covered
* **Pure React:** Creating elements without JSX to understand `React.createElement`.
* **Hooks Deep Dive:** Managing state and side effects.
* **React Router:** Single Page Application (SPA) navigation.
* **Async State:** Fetching data from external APIs.
* **Context:** Managing global state without prop drilling.
